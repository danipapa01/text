Introduction

An “outline” usually comprises a summary of important results, worked examples and
some problems. Each section of this outline of general physics is devoted to a particular
area of physics. Each section contains a few formulae which every physicist should know.
These are intended as reminders only; the symbols are not defined but have their usual
meanings. Then there is a set of questions chosen to cover the topics, taken from past
third-year general papers. Where the answer can be given without revealing how to do
the problem, then it is given.



-
There will be nine general-paper workshops in semester 6, from week 2 through week
10, each covering one section. You should try as many questions as possible from>
                                                                                the
relevant section before each workshop.

The questions marked with * are the minimum that you should expect to cover for the
workshops, and these must be attempted in advance.

The 2019 third-year general paper is included, as section 9. =You should attempt this
in full before the ninth and last workshop, in week ten. Also included are the Table of
Physical Constants and Conversion Factors, which is issued with all physics examination
papers, and a section on the “Mathematical Formulae You Should Know”.

1     MECHANICS and VIBRATIONS

Newton’s Laws

Difficulties in this area rarely arise from not knowing Newton’s laws:

    1. Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion
       unless an external force is applied to it;
                                                                                    dp
    2. The rate of change of momentum equals the total force on an object, F = dt (
       F = ma for constant mass);
    3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Many problems can be solved quickly and easily by applying conservation of mechan-
ical energy (true when the forces are conservative) and in many cases conservation of
momentum (true when there are no external forces).

Newton’s Laws for Rotation

We often use the equivalent of Newton’s second law for rigid-body rotation. With
                                                                         L2  1
            L = Iw    ,         I = Â mi ri2 ,                    EL =      = I w2   ,
                                       i
                                                                         2I  2

we have Newton’s second law for torque
                               T = dL/dt = I dw/dt .
Note that these equations are easy to remember. Apart from the one defining the moment
of inertia, they are analogous to the ones for linear motion, with the substitutions:
                  m!I      ,    v!w         ,        p!L      ,       F!T      .
Most of the time we shall only consider rotation around an axis of fixed direction, which
can be treated as one-dimensional. In that case we drop the vector notation above.

Damped Oscillators

The Equation of motion for a forced, damped simple harmonic oscillator is
                                 ẍ + g ẋ + w02 x = F/m      .
For sinusoidal driving force F (t) = F0 cos wt the amplitude is:
                                                  F0 /m
                          A(w ) =                                        .
                                    [(w02        2
                                                w )2 + (gw )2 ]1/2
Critical damping occurs when g = 2w0 . The full width of power curve at half maximum
equals g, and the Q-value is Q = w0 /g.
The amplitude of the oscillations in the absence of forcing is
                                A(t) = A0 exp( gt/2)              .

2    DIMENSIONS, ASTRONOMY and DATA ANALYSIS

The method of dimensions

All equations in physics must be dimensionally consistent (i.e. both sides must have the
same units). It is sometimes possible to deduce an approximate formula, usually up to
a multiplicative constant, by combining the relevant quantities in such a way as to get
the right units. This can be used in practice by assuming that a physical quantity Z that
depends on a number of other quantities A, B, C, . . . must obey a power law to make the
dimensions on the left and right-hand sides be equal. We thus set Z = cAa B b C g . . ., with
c a dimensionless constant. We solve by equating the powers on the basic units on left-
and right-hand sides (usually length, time and mass are sufficient; occasionally we need
to consider temperature and current; the candela is not usually required). If there is one
unique set of powers a, b, g etc. that satisfy the equality of dimensions, then we have
determined a suitable functional form of Z. The method fails to provide a unique solution
                                                   0   0   0
if there is a dimensionless quantity of the form Aa B b C g . . ..

Note that temperature usually enters into physical quantities as kT or equivalently RT,
which both have the dimensions of energy. The SI units of viscosity are kg m 1 s 1 .
Surface tension may be considered as force per unit length or energy per unit area, and
has units of kg s 2 .

Introductory Astronomy

Kepler’s third law: T 2 = kR3 (k = 1 if T is in years and R is in astronomical units).

Blackbody radiation: P = sT 4 is power emitted per unit area. (Stefan’s law)

Difference in magnitude: Dm = 2.5 log10 R, where R is the brightness ratio.

Non-relativistic Doppler shift: Dl/l = v/c.

Reduced mass for a 2-body system: µ = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ).

Orbit around common centre of mass: m1 R1 = m2 R2 .

   1. * By dimensional arguments show that the speed of waves on a deep body of liquid
      is independent of the liquid density if the waves are long enough to be controlled
      by gravity, but not if they are so short as to be controlled by surface tension.
   2. After being deformed, a spherical drop of an incompressible liquid will execute
      periodic vibrations. Use the method of dimensions to obtain an expression for the
      frequency of these vibrations in terms of the physical properties of the drop.

      density of air and the time elapsed since the explosion. At t = 0.006 s the radius

     which occurs when light is reflected at a boundary with a less dense medium.

Complex Numbers
The imaginary unit i is defined by i2 = 1; the symbol “j” is sometimes used as well.
A complex number can be written in terms of real and imaginary part, or in terms of the modulus r and
angle ✓ (de Moivre’s theorem),

     r ⌘ z = x + iy = rei✓ = r[cos ✓ + i sin ✓],                     ✓ = arctan(y/x)      .

Under complex conjugation we take i !                       i,

     z⇤ = x       iy = re   i✓
                                 = r[cos ✓         i sin ✓].

The modulus of z is the real number
          p       p
     |z| = z ⇤ z = x2 + y 2 .

We can define the sine and cosine in terms of complex numbers by

Trigonometry

     sin2 x + cos2 x = 1,
     sin(x ± y) = sin x cos y ± cos x sin y,
     cos(x ± y) = cos x cos y ⌥ sin x sin y,

Partial Derivatives
Given a function of more than one variable, e.g., f = f (x, y), we have

     df =          dx +        dy.

Differential equations

Vectors
A vector a is defined by its components as

     a = (ax , ay , az ) = ax î + ay ĵ + az k̂.

The modulus (length) of a is
               q                 p
     |a|(⌘ a) = a2x + a2y + a2z = a · a.

Scalar product

     a · b = ax bx + ay by + az bz = |a||b| cos ✓.

Vector product

     a ⇥ b = (ay bz       az by , az bx   ax bz , ax by   ay bx ) = ax ay az = ab sin ✓n̂.

The vectors a, b and the unit vector n̂ form a right-handed set.

Scalar Triple Product

                                               ax ay az

Coordinate systems
Vector coordinates: The position vector is usually called r,

     r ⌘ xî + y ĵ + z k̂.

The radial distance from the origin is then
         p
     r = x2 + y 2 + z 2 .

The direction of r is given by the unit vector r̂ = r/r.

     r̂ = r/r, ˆ = ( sin , cos );
     grad = r̂@r + ˆ @ ,
     dA = rdrd     (Area element)

Cylindrical polar coordinates (⇢, , z)
For ⇢ and read the 2D plane polar coordinates above.

     ˆ = (cos , sin , 0), ˆ = ( sin , cos , 0);
     ⇢
     grad = ⇢ˆ @⇢ + ˆ @ + k̂@z ,
     dV = ⇢d⇢d dz         (Volume element)

Note: One often meets r instead of ⇢. Avoid this to reduce confusion.

Spherical coordinates (r, ✓, )
